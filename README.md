# breakpoint-exporter README

## Features

Export and import breakpoints

## How it works

Export your breakpoints with the 'Export Breakpoints' command.

This will create a temporary json in new tab. You can store it or directly copy it for import.

For import you need the 'Import Breakpoints' and paste the json in the prompt.

**The project in which you import breakpints must have the same path as the one from which you have made the export**
